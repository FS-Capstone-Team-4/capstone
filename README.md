# Team 4 

This document describes our team social contract for this project

## Roles:

* Task master: 
* Git master: 
* Test master: 

## Daily Process

* Start with a group standup (less than 15 mins total)
    - Task master facilitates and calls on each person for an update
    - Each person says what they've worked on, what they accomplished since last standup and any blockers they have encountered
* At the end of each standup we rotate the roles 
* Begin to work on assigned tasks for that day (making sure to pull in changes from previous merges)
    - bring up questions or issues in our team slack channel after 20 mins of being blocked by one issue
* When a task is complete we make a PR and have at least one other member review and approve before merging. 
    - The PR must be approved and pass CircleCi tests before it can merge

## Team Expectations

* Each of us reserves the rights to our weekends and we have been straightforward with how and when we can commit to working on the project
* If we have a blocking issue, we will post a slack message to the team before DMing one person
* None of us will specialize in front-end or back-end code
* Don't interrupt - raise your hand
* We will allow space for everyone to speak 
* Discuss when we disagree - argue infrequently 
* We will message the group when we change what task we are working on
* We will use a board of cards to show what issues are being worked on and what issues need to be done

## Issues

* If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
    
    1. Take 5 - 10 min break
    2. List out the pros / cons 
    3. Vote on it
    4. If the vote is split, escalate to our mentor or instructor

* If we are frustrated:

    - We will take a walk or get some water
    - Talk constructively about actionable items 
    - Bring in a 3rd party to mediate
