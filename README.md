# Polifacts

This is a web app that is designed to offer easy access to information on your congresspeople and senators. It draws from an axios API to keep data on recent senators and their votes on recent bills.

Built in React using drawing from a PostgreSQL database for static information and the axios API for information that needs updating. Frontend built with Material UI.

# Landing page
